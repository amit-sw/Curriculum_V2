Welcome to the Curriculum V2 application.
We follow a three-step process to create and manage educational content:
1. **Brainstorming**: Generate ideas and outlines for content.
2. **Slide Creation**: Develop detailed slide-by-slide content based on the brainstormed ideas.
3. **File Generation**: Save slides and content into stylized PPTX files for distribution.

Please also note that the Navigation bar at the top allows you to switch between different sections of the application.
